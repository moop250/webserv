Starting with an example,
	prototype a server as :

"
	server {
		...
		...
		...
	}
"

It works by the following rules :

1) Define his range by '{}' as :
	server { ... }

2) Each attribute must be splitted by ';' as :
	server { ... ; ... }

3) There can be multiple servers as :
	server { ... }
	server { ... }

4) The server accepted attributes have to be formated as :
	- hosts				: <"host" host>
	- listeners (mutilple host:port): <"listen" port>
	- server name			: <"server_name" name>
	- root path			: <"root" path>
	- index				: <"index" file>
	- autoindex			: <"autoindex" ON | OFF> 
	- error pages			: <"error_page" nb path>
	- upload storage		: <"upload_storage" path>
	- CGI extention			: <"cgi_ext" file.py | file.php>
	- CGI PATH			: <"cgi_path" path>
	- client allowed size		: <"client_max_body" size>
	- Methods allowed		: <"allow_methods" M1 M2 ... Mi>
	- location bloc			: <"location" path { ... }>
	
5) The location bloc has to respect the same format as a server

6) There can be multiple location ports in a same server

7) The location accepted attributes are the same as server except :
	- hosts
	- listen
	- location
	- server name

8) A token is formated as <token>

9) if no argument is given to webserv a default cinfiguration take place
	
...)
	...

N) If one of the precedent rules aren't respected, the programm won't launch
